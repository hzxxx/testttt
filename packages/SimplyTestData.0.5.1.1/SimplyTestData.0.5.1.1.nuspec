    <description>It's a very subtle test data factory with flexible capabilities to customize created objects. Permanent customizations per type can be defined in order to be always applied on-the-fly to objects being created. At the same time any number of additional ad-hoc customizations can be applied in particular test case.

Generally the syntax is extremely simple. Since every customization is an Action&lt;T&gt; where T is the type of created object. This leads to the very clean and expressive test code.

Note that this micro-framework is NOT opposed to data generation libraries or frameworks such as NBuilder or AutoPoco but can nicely complement them in most of the cases.
